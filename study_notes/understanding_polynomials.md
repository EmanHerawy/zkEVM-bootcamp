## Understanding polynomials

**What are Polynomials?**

Polynomials are mathematical expressions represented by terms with coefficients and variables. 

Polynomial comes from poly- (meaning "many") and -nomial (in this case meaning "term") ... so it says "many terms"
The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable. Examples include linear (degree 1), quadratic (degree 2), and cubic (degree 3) polynomials.

### **Terminology:**

1. **Degree:** The highest power of the variable in a polynomial.![Alt text](image-3.png)
2. **Coefficients:** Numerical values in front of each term.![Alt text](image-2.png)
3. **Leading Coefficient:** The coefficient of the term with the highest degree.![Alt text](image-4.png)
4. **Roots (Zeros):** Values making the polynomial zero.
5. **Factorization:** Expressing a polynomial as a product of simpler polynomials. example:\(x^2-9) could be factored as (x+3)(x-3)\ and easily  find the root and solve it for x=3 and x=-3.
