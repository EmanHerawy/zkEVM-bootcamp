# Sets Theory and Logic 
## Definitions & Symbols

## Set Theory Basics:
- **Definition of a Set:** A set is a collection of elements, often represented with curly brackets. Elements are the items within the set `{1,2,3,4}`.
 
    - **Order of Elements:** The order of elements in a set is irrelevant; rearranging them does not change the set.
    - **Naming Sets:** Sets are often named with **capital letters**
    - **Cardinality:** The cardinality of a set is a measure of how many elements are in the set.
        - **Symbol** |A| = 5 means that set A has 5 elements.


## Special Sets:
1. **`∅`Empty Set:**
   - **Symbol:** Represented as `∅` or `{}`.
   - **Definition:** A set with no elements.
2. **Finite Set:**
   - **Definition:** A set with a finite number of elements, listed within curly brackets.
3. **`ℕ`Natural Numbers:**
   - **Symbol:** Represented as `ℕ`.
   - **Definition:** Whole numbers starting from 1.
4. **`ℤ`Integers:**
   - **Symbol:** Represented as `ℤ`.
   - **Definition:** Natural numbers, zero, and their negatives.
5. **`ℚ`Rational Numbers:**
   - **Symbol:** Represented as `ℚ`.
   - **Definition:** Fractions or numbers expressible as a ratio of integers.
   - **Representation** you need to Set Builder Notation like this : `ℚ = {m/n | m, n ∈ ℤ, n ≠ 0}`
6. **`ℝ`Real Numbers:**
   - **Symbol:** Represented as `ℝ`.
   - **Definition:** All numbers on the number line.
7. **`ℂ`Complex Numbers:**
   - **Symbol:** Represented as `ℂ`.
   - **Definition:**  

## Set Builder Notation for Rational Numbers:
- **Definition:** Set builder notation is a way of describing a set by listing the properties that all elements in the set must satisfy.

## Intervals:
1. **Closed Interval [a, b]:**
   -  
2. **Open Interval (a, b):**
   - (a, b) = {x | a < x < b}
   - [a, b] = {x | a ≤ x ≤ b}
3. **Half-Open Intervals:**
   - [a, b) = {x | a ≤ x < b}
   - (a, b] = {x | a < x ≤ b}
  
4. **Infinite Intervals:**
   - [-∞, b) = {x | x < b}
   - (-∞, b] = {x | x ≤ b}
   - [-∞, b] = {x | x ≤ b}
   - (-∞, b) = {x | x < b}
   - (a, ∞) = {x | x < a}
   - [a, ∞] =  {x | x ≤ a}
   - [a, ∞) =  {x | x < a}
   - [-∞, ∞] = ℝ
   - (-∞, ∞) = ℝ
