    - **STARKs** are more scalable and transparent, but they require more computational resources and generate larger proofs. **SNARKs** are more efficient in terms of computation and storage, but they require a trusted setup and are less transparent.
    - R1CS and AIR, fundamental in arithmetization, represent and verify computations in zero-knowledge proofs. R1CS, using linear equations, is efficient for small variable circuits in SNARKs. AIR complements this with efficient representation through quadratic equations for arbitrary computations.
