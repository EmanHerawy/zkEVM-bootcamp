## EIP-2930
 **Summary of EIP-2930 - Ethereum Access List:**

**Introduction:**
EIP-2930 introduces Ethereum access list transactions, allowing gas savings on cross-contract calls by declaring in advance the accessed contracts and storage slots. This can save up to 100 gas per accessed storage slot.

**Motivation:**
EIP-2930 addresses breaking changes introduced by EIP-2929, which increased the cost of cold storage access. EIP-2929 aimed to prevent denial-of-service attacks but inadvertently disrupted some smart contracts. EIP-2930, as an optional access list, serves to mitigate these issues.

**How It Works:**
- EIP-2930 transactions operate similarly to regular transactions but prepay the cold storage cost with a discount, avoiding costs during SLOAD execution.
- No modifications to Solidity code are required, as it's specified client-side.
- The prepaid cold access facilitates more efficient execution, especially when storage keys are known in advance, enabling Ethereum node clients to pre-fetch storage values.

**Charging Less for Access:**
- Berlin hard fork raised cold access costs but introduced a 200 gas discount for EIP-2930 transactions, reducing the overall transaction cost.
- Cold access to account opcodes and state access opcode (SLOAD) now costs 2400 and 1900 gas, respectively, while warm access costs 100 gas.


**Access List Generation:**
- Access lists are challenging to construct in real-time, but EIP-2930 provides a 10% initial discount, encouraging developers to adopt them.

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Incorrectly calculating storage slots can result in paying for the access list without realizing its benefits.
- Access lists are not suitable for non-deterministic storage slots or scenarios where slot calculation depends on block numbers or transaction timing.
