**Summary of EIP Proposal (Gas Cost Increase):**

**Simple Summary:**
This proposal increases the gas cost for certain opcodes (SLOAD, *CALL, BALANCE, EXT*, and SELFDESTRUCT) when used for the first time in a transaction, aiming to address historical underpricing and enhance short-term security.

**Abstract:**
The gas cost for SLOAD is increased to 2100, and for *CALL, BALANCE, and EXT* opcodes to 2600. Exceptions apply for precompiles and addresses/storage slots already accessed in the same transaction, receiving reduced gas costs. The proposal also adjusts SSTORE and SELFDESTRUCT to ensure accurate pricing of inherent storage loads.

**Motivation:**
Historically, storage-accessing opcodes were underpriced, leading to potential denial-of-service attacks. This proposal addresses this by increasing gas costs, aiming to reduce worst-case processing time and improve stateless witness sizes in Ethereum.

**Specification:**
- Maintains sets of accessed_addresses and accessed_storage_keys throughout a transaction.
- Gas cost changes based on whether an address or storage key has been accessed in the transaction, with exemptions for known addresses and precompiles.
- Adjusts gas costs for SSTORE, *CALL variants, and SELFDESTRUCT.
- Implements changes from a specified FORK_BLOCK.

**Rationale:**
- The proposal increases gas costs rather than charging per byte of witness data for short-term security relief.
- Introduces accessed_addresses and accessed_storage_keys sets to avoid redundant charges for cached data and enable contract breakage mitigations.

 

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- Gas cost increases may impact contracts relying on fixed gas costs, but risks are expected to be low due to developer awareness.
