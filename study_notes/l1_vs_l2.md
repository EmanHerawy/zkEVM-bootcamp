## elemental understanding of Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchain architectures 

1. **Blockchain Architectures Overview:**
   - Three primary design paths: Monolithic chains, Modular chains with rollups, and Fully Succinct chains.
   - Comparison of smart contract platforms in terms of architecture.

2. **Monolithic Chains:**
   - L1 handles all execution and data storage.
   - Data is required for transaction execution.
   - Examples: Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana.

3. **Modular Chains with Rollups:**
   - Computation is moved off-chain, and rollups are used.
   - Sequencers supply state updates to the main chain based on off-chain computation.
   - Data is needed for user withdrawals without external assistance.
   - Examples: Ethereum 2.0, Syscoin NEVM.

4. **Fully Succinct Chains:**
   - No data or previous state is required to prove the blockchain's state.
   - Validators or sequencers execute transactions and create validity proofs on L1.
   - Data is used for historical purposes and accounting records.
   - Examples: Mir Protocol, Mina Protocol.
